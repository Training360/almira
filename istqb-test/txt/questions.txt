B. A-Don’t Issue membership, B-Don’t offer discount.
C. A-Issue membership, No discount, B-Don’t Issue membership.
D. Issue membership, No discount, B- Issue membership with 10% discount.


Q. 1051: Why can be a tester dependent on configuration management?

A. Because configuration management assures that we know the exact version of the testware and the test object.
B. Because test execution is not allowed to proceed without the consent of the change control board.
C. Because changes in the test object are always subject to configuration management.
D. Because configuration management assures the right configuration of the test tools.


Q. 1052: Why is successful test execution automation difficult?

A. Because the tools for automated testing require too much effort for learning.
B. Because the maintenance of the test system is difficult.
C. Because the test robot tools are restricted in their ability to recognize outputs.
D. Because the test robot needs to be supported by a test management.


Q. 1053: Why is it necessary to define a Test Strategy?

A. As there are many different ways to test software, thought must be given to decide what will be the most effective way to test the project on hand.
B. Starting testing without prior planning leads to chaotic and inefficient test project.
C. A strategy is needed to inform the project management how the test team will schedule the test-cycles.
D. Software failure may cause loss of money, time, business reputation, and in extreme cases injury and death. It is therefore critical to have a proper test strategy in place.

Q. 1060: One of the differences between the Modified Condition Decision Coverage and the Condition Coverage is:

A. The Condition Coverage ensures all paths through a module are executed whereas the Modified Condition Decision Coverage ensures each path in a decision can independently affect the outcome.
B. The Modified Condition Decision Coverage ensures all alternative paths are executed whereas the Condition Coverage ensure all main paths are executed.
C. The Condition Coverage ensures each condition takes all possible outcomes at least once whereas the Modified Condition Decision Coverage requires both maximum and minimum values within each field.
D. The Modified Condition Decision Coverage relies on the tester’s skill and past experience whereas the Condition Coverage relies on the way in which the system moves from one condition to another.
